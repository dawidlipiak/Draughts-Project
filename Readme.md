# DraughtsProject
Draughts projetct designed and done by Wiktoria Szcze≈õniak and Dawid Lipiak. There are three versions of the game: Italian, German and Spanish. You can play with friend or with bot. We used two design patterns. Strategy Pattern to easily add new versions of the game and Model-View-Controller Pattern to separate layers of application. Project also contains tests to check logic of the movements and some other functions.
